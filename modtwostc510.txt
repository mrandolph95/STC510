Once I completed this I realized the script was requested :(. I pushed a lot 
of buttons to get the first lines in there, and I'm afraid to do more damage 
(I keep getting messages indicating that I'm almost out of storage). Anyways,
I hope explaining what I did will be somewhat sufficient.

First, I downloaded, unzipped, and archived your log.csv file by entering,

curl -s -L https://www.dropbox.com/s/14jagxjbzhyxg8g/log.tar.gz?dl=0 
modtwostc510.tar.gz

I made sure to include -L as I was gathering something from a dropbox
and wanted to bypass the extra clicks - it was a "link forwarder". Next,

tar -xvzf modtwostc510.tar.gz

which extracted the file log.csv

I was looking for a file named,  "education, something-something,
 dot tee-ex-tee." so I used grep to search within the file.

grep 'education[a-z]*.txt' log.csv

The lines were a bit execessive and I wanted everything to be
neatly listed. I also wanted to add the lines to a text file.

grep -o 'education[a-z]*txt' log.csv > modtwostc510.txt

Now, I needed to add this to my repository that I created on
Github named "STC510". I switched over to the repository by
imputting, 

cd STC510

Once there, I added the file to the repository and added my
name and a title.

nano STC510

"Mali Randolph, Module Two"

^X then "return/enter"

fast forward and now we're here :)
